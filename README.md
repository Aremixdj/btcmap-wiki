## editing a page

Page edits can be made by making changes to the Markdown file in the `src` directory. You can then open a Pull Request to have your updates merged. You can also begin editing by simply clicking the **edit** button in the top right on any page.

## running locally

1. `git clone` the repo and `cd` into the directory
2. run `yarn` to install the packages
3. `yarn dev` will open the app on `localhost:3000`
