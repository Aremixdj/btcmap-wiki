# Verifying Locations

## Verify, don't trust. üïµÔ∏è

Does a location accept bitcoin?

You can verify this in a number of ways:

- visit the location in person
- phone the location
- check their website or other online sources
- ask a local in the area
- contact via social media
- send them an email

Once a location has been verified you can update the [survey tags](tagging-instructions.html#verified-tags---more-information) on OpenStreetMap so that the location will have a [checkmark](map-legend.html#verified) visible on BTC Map.

Below is an email template for the UK that you can use as a starting point and adapt it to contain correct information about your own local area.

Hello,

I appreciate that you are busy, so thank you for taking a couple of minutes to read and respond to this email. I'm part of a team of volunteers working on [BTCmap.org](https://btcmap.org/) - an open source map which shows all merchants which accept Bitcoin worldwide. According to OpenStreetMap data, your business accepts Bitcoin - or perhaps did so in the past!

Please can you reply to this email with the following information:

**A) Yes, we still accept Bitcoin!**

**B) We no longer accept Bitcoin, but would be interested in accepting it in the future**

**C) We no longer accept Bitcoin and have no interest in accepting it in the future**

Before you respond with Option C) you might want to consider that Bitcoin payments have come a long way in recent years...

- The "Lightning network" allows Bitcoin to be sent near-instantly with very low fees - you can even accept contactless [Bitcoin card](https://www.boltcard.org/) payments!
- Services such as [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/) allow you to automatically convert the Bitcoin you receive into GBP.
- There is a growing community of bitcoiners who want to spend their "sats". Accept it and they will come!
- Free and impartial advice on getting started is available from [Bridge2Bitcoin](http://bridge2bitcoin.com/).

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Happy to chat and answer any questions that you may have!

All the best,

Matt
