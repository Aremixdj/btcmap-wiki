# Tagging Hashing Sites

For those wanting to tag locations that perform hashing (mining), you should use the following tags:

`man_made=works`

`product=bitcoin`

As described here: [Tag:man_made=works](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dworks).

AND

`telecom=data_center`

`building=data_center`

As described here: [OSM Wiki - Telecoms-Datacenters](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Telecoms#Datacenters) and [Tag:telecom=data_center](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:telecom%3Ddata_center).

AND _OPTIONALLY_

`operator=*` - The operator of the datacenter. In the case of a corporate datacenter, this will be the organisation which owns it. In the case of a colocation facility, this will be the colocation company.

`name=*` - The name of the datacenter.

`owner=*` - Some datacenters are constructed and owned by one company, but long-term leased in their entirety to another company to operate.
