# Communities

BTC Map Communities are areas on the map, but they are also much more!

They are hubs of activity that connect local bitcoiners with each other and with local merchants. They provide focus for a community to help onboard new people and businesses to bitcoin.

You can add a community [here](https://btcmap.org/communities/add), other useful links are the communities [directory](https://btcmap.org/communities) and [leaderboard](https://btcmap.org/communities/leaderboard).

Each community gets their own page to track progress on BTC Map. You will receive a Grade based on your number of Up-To-Date locations. We provide all the metrics and data visualization needed to ensure you can maintain a high quality community in the bitcoin mapping context.

Bitcoin mapping communities maintain their local datasets and strive to have the most accurate information. Take ownership of your local data and help drive adoption. Bitcoin communities are the spark that ignites the movement. Join your friends and have fun!
