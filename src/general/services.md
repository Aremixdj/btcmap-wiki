# Services

Local services that accept bitcoin are great, however in order to be mapped they need to have a real physical location. OpenStreetMap rules state that [verification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Verifiability) is a key component to being eligible for mapping. This means that anyone should be able to visit the location and verify that it exists as described on the map. Services are accepted if they have an in-person location. If not, then there are other good options for being discovered by bitcoiners listed below:

- [satmap](https://satmap.app/)
- [BitList](https://www.bitlist.com/)
- [Spend in Bitcoin](https://spendinbitcoin.com/)
