Locations with a **Survey Date** that is less than one year old will have a verified checkmark indicating that the information is most likely up-to-date. If you visit a location and are able to pay with bitcoin it is best practice to update the `survey:date`, `check_date`, or `check_date:currency:XBT` tag yourself. More information on which tag to use can be found [here](tagging-instructions.html#verified-tags---more-information). Thanks for contributing to bitcoin open mapping!
