# Outdated Locations

As Satoshi Nakamoto [clearly stated](https://btcmap.org/bitcoin.pdf), Bitcoin is an electronic cash system, and the best way to accelerate Bitcoin adoption is to create a [circular enomomy](https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/a-look-at-bitcoin-circular-economies-around-the-world/).

Keeping a list of all participating merchants is the best way to bootstrap new regions. All bitcoiners should be able to find each other and trade goods and services without touching the fiat infrastructure. That's what we're working on, and we need your help.

Nothing lasts forever, and our merchants are no exception. Some shops may get out of business or just move across the street, that's why we need to check on them from time to time. We're trying to check every merchant at least once a year, and we can't do it without the help of the local bitcoiners.

If you want to help us accelerate Bitcoin adoption, please read this simple step-by-step guide:

## 1. Find a Merchant on OpenStreetMap

Let's say you're living in (or visiting) Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and you want to check the merchants nearby:

It looks like this cafe accepts Bitcoins, and the last verification date is 2024-01-28. In order to re-check this place, you need to open it on OpenStreetMap ("More" --> "View OSM"):

## 2. Update Merchant Details

Now, press the "Edit" button to open a place editor:

Check that all fields are valid and accurate. If some fields are outdated or false, update them.

## 3. Bump Check Date

Set the "Last Checked Date" field value to today and then press "Save":

Every OSM change needs a short description. If you only changed the check date, you can type "Bump check date". If you updated some other fields, you can mention that as well. After fillind the changeset comment, hit the "Upload" button.

## 4. You're Awesome!

As you can see, verifying locations usually takes a couple of minutes, and everyone can do it.
